      <Heading>Beliefs</Heading>- I believe in improving any and everything if
      it can be, irrespective of its current state. This applies to anything and
      everything in life, be it yourself, relations, products, skills, and so
      on. There is so much to learn and with the amount of information available
      to us now, we are more than capable to improve things around us and make
      the changes we want to see. 
      <Text>My second belief follows after my first. I
      don&apos;t believe in the quote “If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it” by T. Bert
      (Thomas Bertram) Lance, the Director of the Office of Management and
      Budget in Jimmy Carter&apos;s 1977 administration. I believe as long as
      we(humans) create something, we are bound to make some human errors. It
      might take us some time to realize the issue and improve upon it, but we
      are able to improve. If we don&apos;t do this, we are not pushing ourselves to
      the limit and would never know our true potential.</Text>
